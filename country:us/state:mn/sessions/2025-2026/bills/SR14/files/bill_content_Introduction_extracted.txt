The 17.19latter motion is debatable solely as to the time.

If the motion for the previous 18.11question is supported by a majority of the members present, its effect is to put an end to all debate 18.12and bring the Senate to a direct vote upon all pending amendments in their order and then upon the 18.13main question. 18.1431.2On a motion for the previous question, a call of the Senate is in order before the President 18.15submits the question to the Senate. 18.1631.3On a motion for the previous question there is no debate.

The President 19.23may put the question to the body if the President chooses. If put to the body, the question is "Is the 19.24point of order well taken?" The President must inform the body that a "yes" vote means the point 19.25of order is well taken and the amendment is not germane and a "no" vote means the point of order 19.26is not well taken and the amendment is germane. If there is a tie vote, the point of order is not well 19.27taken, and the amendment is germane. 19.2835.5A motion to remove an amendment placed on a House bill under Rule 45.1 is out of 19.29order if removal of the amendment would make a portion of the House bill not germane to the 19.30Senate companion for which it was substituted. 19.3135.6If a House amendment to a Senate bill is not germane to the Senate bill, a motion to 19.32concur in the House amendment is out of order. 20.136.DEBATE 20.236.1When a member is about to speak to the Senate, the member shall must rise and 20.3respectfully address "Madam (or Mr.) President."

The 17.19latter motion is debatable solely as to the time. When either motion is rejected, it may not be renewed 17.20until further business has been transacted. 17.2129.2A motion to adjourn sine die is subject to debate, amendment, and subsidiary motions. 17.2230.MOTION TO RECONSIDER 17.2330.1When a motion or question has been decided, a member who voted with the prevailing 17.24side may move for reconsideration: 17.25(1) on the same day on which the vote was taken; 17.26(2) within the next two calendar days; or 17.27(3) if after the time provided under clause (1) or (2), on the first day the Senate meets after 17.28the vote was taken.

If the motion for the previous 18.11question is supported by a majority of the members present, its effect is to put an end to all debate 18.12and bring the Senate to a direct vote upon all pending amendments in their order and then upon the 18.13main question. 18.1431.2On a motion for the previous question, a call of the Senate is in order before the President 18.15submits the question to the Senate. 18.1631.3On a motion for the previous question there is no debate.

The President 19.23may put the question to the body if the President chooses. If put to the body, the question is "Is the 19.24point of order well taken?" The President must inform the body that a "yes" vote means the point 19.25of order is well taken and the amendment is not germane and a "no" vote means the point of order 19.26is not well taken and the amendment is germane. If there is a tie vote, the point of order is not well 19.27taken, and the amendment is germane. 19.2835.5A motion to remove an amendment placed on a House bill under Rule 45.1 is out of 19.29order if removal of the amendment would make a portion of the House bill not germane to the 19.30Senate companion for which it was substituted. 19.3135.6If a House amendment to a Senate bill is not germane to the Senate bill, a motion to 19.32concur in the House amendment is out of order. 20.136.DEBATE 20.236.1When a member is about to speak to the Senate, the member shall must rise and 20.3respectfully address "Madam (or Mr.) President."
